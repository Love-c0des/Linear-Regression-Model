# Linear Regression Model on Temperature Dataset

This repository contains a Linear Regression model implementation in Machine Learning to predict temperatures based on historical data.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to build a Linear Regression model that predicts temperature using a dataset containing historical temperature data. This project demonstrates the application of supervised learning techniques to real-world data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical temperature data. The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Date**: The date of the recorded temperature.
- **Temperature**: The recorded temperature on that date.

## Files

- `linear_regression_model.py` or `linear_regression_model.ipynb`: The main script or Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the Linear Regression model.
- `temperature_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python libraries and dependencies required to run the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
